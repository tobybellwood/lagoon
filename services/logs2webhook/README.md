# Logs to Webhook (`logs2webhook`)

Watches all the Lagoon logs and checks for events that should trigger a webhook call. Each log message is tied to a Lagoon project, and channel configuration
for that project is retrieved from the Lagoon API.

Examples of events that might trigger a message: GitHub pull request opened, a
new build for a Lagoon project environent has started, a task was completed.
