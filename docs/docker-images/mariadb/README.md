# MariaDB

MariaDB is the open source successor to MySQL.

The [Lagoon `MariaDB` image Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/mariadb/Dockerfile). Based on the official packages `mariadb` and `mariadb-client` provided by the `alpine:3.8` image.

This Dockerfile is intended to be used to set up a standalone MariaDB database server.

## Lagoon adaptions

This image is prepared to be used on Lagoon. There are therefore some things already done:

* Folder permissions are automatically adapted with [`fix-permissions`](https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container/blob/master/core/root/usr/bin/fix-permissions), so this image will work with a random user.
* `readiness-probe.sh` script to check when MariaDB container is ready.

## Included tools

* [`mysqltuner.pl`](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl) - Perl script useful for database parameter tuning.
* [`mysql-backup.sh`](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/mariadb/mysql-backup.sh) - Script for automating the daily MySQL backups on development environment.
* [`pwgen`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwgen) - Utility to generate random and complex passwords.

## Included `my.cnf` configuration file

The image ships a _default_ MariaDB configuration file, optimized to work on Lagoon. Some options are configurable via environments variables \(see [Environment Variables](../../using-lagoon-advanced/environment-variables.md)\).

## Environment Variables

Environment variables defined in MariaDB base image:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MARIADB_DATABASE` | lagoon | Database name created at startup. |
| `MARIADB_USER` | lagoon | Default user created at startup. |
| `MARIADB_PASSWORD` | lagoon | Password of default user created at startup. |
| `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Lag00n | MariaDB root user's password. |
| `MARIADB_CHARSET` | utf8mb4 | Set the server charset. |
| `MARIADB_COLLATION` | utf8mb4\_bin | Set server collation. |
| `MARIADB_MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET` | 64M | Set the max\_allowed\_packet size. |
| `MARIADB_INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE` | 256M | Set the MariaDB InnoDB buffer pool size. |
| `MARIADB_INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_INSTANCES` | 1 | Number of InnoDB buffer pool instances. |
| `MARIADB_INNODB_LOG_FILE_SIZE` | 64M | Size of InnoDB log file. |
| `MARIADB_LOG_SLOW` | empty | Variable to control the save of slow queries. |
| `MARIADB_LOG_QUERIES` | empty | Variable to control the save of ALL queries. |
| `BACKUPS_DIR` | /var/lib/mysql/backup | Default path for databases backups. |
| `MARIADB_DATA_DIR` | /var/lib/mysql | Path of the mariadb data dir, be careful, changing this can occur data loss! |
| `MARIADB_COPY_DATA_DIR_SOURCE` | unset | Path which the entrypoint script of mariadb will use to copy into the defined `MARIADB_DATA_DIR`, this can be used for prepopulating the MariaDB with a database. The scripts expects actual MariaDB data files and not a sql file! Plus it only copies data if the destination does not already have a mysql datadir in it. |

If the `LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` variable is set to `production`, performances are set accordingly by using `MARIADB_INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE=1024` and `MARIADB_INNODB_LOG_FILE_SIZE=256`.
