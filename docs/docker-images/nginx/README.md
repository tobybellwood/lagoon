# NGINX

The [Lagoon `nginx` image Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/nginx/Dockerfile). Based on the official [`openresty/openresty` images](https://hub.docker.com/r/openresty/openresty/).

This Dockerfile is intended to be used as a base for any web servers within Lagoon.

## Lagoon adaptions

This image is prepared to be used on Lagoon. There are therefore some things already done:

* Folder permissions are automatically adapted with [`fix-permissions`](https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container/blob/master/core/root/usr/bin/fix-permissions), so this image will work with a random user.
* The files within `/etc/nginx/*` are parsed through [`envplate`](https://github.com/kreuzwerker/envplate) with a container-entrypoint.

## Included `NGINX` configuration \(`static-files.conf`\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default `NGINX` only serves static files - this can be used for static sites that don't require a database or PHP components: for example, static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

If you need PHP, have a look at the `php-fpm` image and use `nginx` and `php-fpm` in tandem.
{% endhint %}

Build the content during the build process and inject it into the `nginx` container.

## Helpers

### `redirects-map.conf`

In order to create redirects, we have `redirects-map.conf` in place. This helps you to redirect marketing domains to sub-sites or do non-www to www redirects. **If you have a lot of redirects, we suggest having `redirects-map.conf` stored next to your code for easier maintainability.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you only have a few redirects, there's a handy trick to create the redirects with a `RUN` command in your `nginx.dockerfile`.
{% endhint %}

Here's an example showing how to redirect `www.example.com` to `example.com` and preserve the request:

```bash
RUN echo "~^www.example.com http://example.com\$request_uri;" >> /etc/nginx/redirects-map.conf
```

To get more details about the various types of redirects that can be achieved, see the documentation within the [`redirects-map.conf`](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/nginx/redirects-map.conf) directly.

After you put the `redirects-map.conf` in place, you also need to include it in your `nginx.dockerfile` in order to get the configuration file into your build.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="nginx.dockerfile" %}
```bash
COPY redirects-map.conf /etc/nginx/redirects-map.conf
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Basic Authentication

If you want to protect your site via basic authentication, you can do this by defining the environment variables `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` within your `.lagoon.env.environment` files. For further explanation on how to set up Environment Variables on Lagoon, [check here](../../using-lagoon-advanced/environment-variables.md).

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are meant to contain common information for the `nginx` container.

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BASIC_AUTH` | `restricted` | By not setting `BASIC_AUTH` this will instruct Lagoon to automatically enable basic authentication if `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` are set. To disable basic authentication even if `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` are set, set `BASIC_AUTH` to `off`. |
| `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` | \(not set\) | Username for basic authentication |
| `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | \(not set\) | Password for basic authentication \(unencrypted\) |
| `FAST_HEALTH_CHECK` | \(not set\) | If set to `true` this will redirect GET requests from certain user agents \(StatusCake, Pingdom, Site25x7, Uptime, nagios\) to the lightweight Lagoon service healthcheck. |
