Want to hack Lagoon? Yay ðŸŽ‰! That's how we all started. At Lagoon we take pride in being able to run everything in a local environment, see [Developing Lagoon](https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon/blob/main/docs/contributing-to-lagoon/developing-lagoon.md) how this works.

## I found a security issue ðŸ”“

We take security very seriously. If you discover a security issue or think you found one, please bring it to the maintainers' attention.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please send your findings to [hello@amazee.io](mailto:hello@amazee.io). Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue for them.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and will receive public karma and swag! We're also working on a Bug Bounty system.
