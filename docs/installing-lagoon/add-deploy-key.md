# Add Deploy Key

Lagoon creates a deploy key for each project. You now need to add it as a deploy key in your Git repository.

1. Run the following command to get the deploy key: `lagoon get project-key --project <projectname>`
2. Copy the key and save it as a deploy key in your Git repository.&#x20;
